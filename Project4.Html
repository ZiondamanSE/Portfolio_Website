            <p class="block-text">The end result was a small game demo that was enough to earn a B. Still, I wish I had more time to add more systems—like items or more mechanics beyond just attacking. Sadly, that didn’t happen, and we ended up making a quick and short demo instead.</p>

            <p class="block-text">For another assignment while I was at LBS Norra, we had to make an RPG. So me and a few mates decided to make a simple Undertale clone. The story was simple: the king accidentally opened the gate and let the monsters in—and now you have to kill them.</p>

            <p class="block-text">I ended up doing most of the project (a bit too hands-on, to be honest), but I really enjoyed it. I made a dialogue system that was also customizable so anyone could use it. I also made the movement system and the character assets for the king and the boss. The attack system was done by a friend, and I just helped fix bugs and cleaned up small imperfections.</p>
