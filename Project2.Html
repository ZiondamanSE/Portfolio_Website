            <p class="block-text">The result of all my hard labor is a deeper understanding of Photoshop’s systems and graphic design as a whole. I can now make assets and poster designs, as well as logos, streaming setups, and so much more with ease—and I keep expanding my knowledge with every project that comes my way.</p>

            <p class="block-title">Origin Story</p>
            <p class="block-text">During 2020, I started a small hobby doing graphic design in my free time. After many, many projects and several hours spent working on building the skill, it eventually paid off—with several people coming to me asking for custom designs and streaming setups.</p>

            <p class="block-title">My Job</p>
            <p class="block-text">Eventually, I got a small job at a gaming group called SOF TAC Gaming, who recruited me and later asked me to be their media head. I worked on designs for their merch, posters, and several other small jobs here and there. Not long after, I also created some streaming setups for a few members of the group.</p>
