            <p class="block-text">The result of all this hard work, sadly, never became a finished project. But it was still something we held close to our hearts. Through this project, we gained valuable programming skills and insight into the world of game development. Even though the end result was a half-finished game, there was still a lot of love put into it.</p>

            <p class="block-title">Origin Story</p>
            <p class="block-text">Unborn was a project where me and my workmate Einar Lundqvist wanted to push our coding capabilities as far as possible—and so Unborn was made. A game project where the focus was on programming and asset creation. The game was set in a strange world where you played as a fetus completing tasks and changing the fate of your life.</p>

            <p class="block-title">My Job</p>
            <p class="block-text">My job was to program and create character assets, along with some light 3D modeling and UV map fixing. I spent a lot of time programming small systems I was really proud of. I built an interactive dialogue system, and also worked on character assets. I helped with modeling—cleaning up models and fixing UVs when needed.</p>
